### Methodology used

- I trained the model initially using Linear Regression. I observed that the model faced an imbalance in predicting the charges in higher budget
- To avoid this underfitting, I opted to a Gradient Boosting model
- Upon switching to the XGBoost model, I got balanced results in comparison to linear regression 
- I performed hyperparameter tuning to fine-tune the model's prediction to close to the reality.
